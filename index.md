	<p>I am a budding data science professional who is passionate about making business and technology work for each other especially in the ad-tech industry.  From an industry exposure perspective, I have 4 years of experience in Data Analytics and Client Servicing across digital marketing, e-commerce, and insurance. I have substantial experience in complex data analysis, text mining, automation, data visualization and deploying machine learning models on real-world data. Working as a client-facing Data Analyst has helped me immensely in empathizing with business problems. I love talking about data and thrive on communicating the insights derived from data to non-technical stakeholders or clients.</p>

<p>Throughout my life, I have always enjoyed engaging in sports and physical education. I have played Junior professional and college tennis in India. At the age of 12, I started touring the country alone to compete in tennis tournaments and learned how to manage my time effectively between practice, matches, and school. I also had the opportunity to captain my regional team for five years and this experience held me in good stead when I led a team of data analysts.</p>

<p>I always bring in a lean sigma perspective to every task I perform. I have undertaken quite a few process improvement endeavors which have positively impacted the teams that I have worked with.</p>

<p>I am also a big sports aficionado. I play Tennis, Badminton, Soccer, Basketball and Table Tennis. I love Roger Federer and the Golden State Warriors and watch all their games.</p>
