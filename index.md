	<p>I am a budding machine learning practioner who is passionate about finding machine learning applications in business and technology. From an industry exposure perspective, I have 4 years of experience in Data Analytics and managing client relationships across digital marketing, e-commerce, and insurance. I have substantial experience in complex data analysis, text mining, automation, data visualization and deploying machine learning models on real-world data. Working as a client-facing Data Analyst has helped me immensely in empathizing with business problems. I love talking about data and thrive on communicating the insights derived from data to non-technical stakeholders or clients. I have published two research papers on applications of Data Science in cybersecurity. I am currently working on a DARPA funded cybersecurity initiative at the school of engineering, University of Virginia to build and deploy a deep learning framework to detect malicious attacks. In addition to working on projects, I am a regular contributor to Towards Data Science, a data science blog</p>

<p>Throughout my life, I have always enjoyed engaging in sports and physical education. I have played Junior professional and college tennis in India. At the age of 12, I started touring the country alone to compete in tennis tournaments and learned how to manage my time effectively between practice, matches, and school. I also had the opportunity to captain my regional team for five years and this experience held me in good stead when I led a team of data analysts. When I am not playing tennis or working on Data Science projects, I teach English to underpriveleged kids in India and teach meditation to young adults.  </p>

<p>I am currently pursing a Master's degree in Data Science at the University of Virgina but a Mechanical Engineer by training.</p>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"> <span style="color:black">1. An Autonomous Labelling Pipeline for Enterprise Network Traffic</span> <span style="float: right; ">SIEDS 2019 (Paper Accepted)</span> </span><br>
A novel labeling methodology using a combination of open source data sets (Blacklist and Whitelist feeds) and honeypot logs that can be implemented in any enterprise network. Labeling network traffic will help organizations build a robust intrusion detection systems.(Funded by DARPA)

<span style="font-weight: bold;"> <span style="color:black">2. Comparison of Supervised Learning Methods for Intrusion Detection in Enterprise Networks</span> <span style="float: right; ">ECML 2019 (Paper Submitted)</span> </span>  <br>
Built and deployed a framework for implementing supervise learning methods on the University of Virginia Network which delivered a accuracy of 98% and a false positive rate less than 1%. The deployed model is an weighted ensemble of feed forward neural network and XGBoost. Invited to speak and present findings at <a href="https://sched.co/Lck6}">Tom Tom Applied Machine Learning Conference</a>. The project is funded in part by DARPA.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"> <span style="color:black">3. Exploratory Data Analysis of the Unified Host and Network Dataset</span> <span style="float: right; ">SIEDS 2019 (Paper Accepted)</span> </span><br>
Uncovered hidden relationships between different variables(Source and Destination Packets) in the Los Alomos National Laboratory's Unified Host and Network Dataset using Unsupervised Learning Methods and verified them using Principal Component Analysis. The hidden relationships can be used to separate anomalous connections through association rule mining.

<span style="font-weight: bold;"> <span style="color:black">1. Fine-Grained Numeral Understanding in Financial Tweets</span> <span style="float: right; "> 2019</span> </span><br>
Developed a deep learning model in Tensorflow using
character-based Convolution Neural Network to classify numerals in financial tweets into categories based on
context which will be used to forecast stock prices based on investor/analyst opinions.)<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"> <span style="color:black">2. Hotel Recommendation System - Booking.com</span> <span style="float: right; "> 2018</span> </span><br>
Built a recommendation engine in Python using k-means clustering
algorithm on data scraped from booking.com. The recommendation engine was powered with user satisfaction
scores from sentiment analysis performed on user reviews.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"> <span style="color:black">3. Flight Delay Prediction - FAA Data</span> <span style="float: right; "> 2018</span> </span><br>
Built a machine learning model that was able to predict flight delay on FAA
flight logs for the year of 2015. Implemented a framework that used a separate model for each level of the high-cardinality categorical variable which shaved the execution time by 80%. The modelâ€™s area under curve in the ROC curve was 0.65.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"> <span style="color:black">4. Application of Bayesian Ensebmbles in Cybersecurity</span> <span style="float: right; "> 2019</span> </span><br>
Currently working a Bayesian Regressive Additive Trees on cybersecurity data set( <a href="https://www.stratosphereips.org/datasets-ctu13/">Dataset</a>) using backfitting Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm that will generate samples from a posterior.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"> <span style="color:black">5. Credit Card Fraud Prediction</span> <span style="float: right; "> 2019</span> </span><br>
Segmented Credit Card Users into different levels of risk based on their probability of defaulting which is based on a deep learning prediction model. The data set used for the project was procured from UC Irvine's Machine Learning Repository. The model was able to make predictions with an accuracy of 87%<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"> <span style="color:black">6. Black Friday Sales Prediction</span> <span style="float: right; "> 2018</span> </span><br>
Segmented Credit Card Users into different levels of risk based on their probability of defaulting which is based on a deep learning prediction model.
