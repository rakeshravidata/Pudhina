	<p>I am a budding data science professional who is passionate about finding machine learning applications in business and technology. From an industry exposure perspective, I have 4 years of experience in Data Analytics and managing client relationships across digital marketing, e-commerce, and insurance. I have substantial experience in complex data analysis, text mining, automation, data visualization and deploying machine learning models on real-world data. Working as a client-facing Data Analyst has helped me immensely in empathizing with business problems. I love talking about data and thrive on communicating the insights derived from data to non-technical stakeholders or clients. I have two research papers on application of Data Science in cybersecurity. I am currently working on a DARPA funded cybersecurity initiative at the University of Virginia to build and deploy a deep learning framework to detect malicious attacks.</p>

<p>Throughout my life, I have always enjoyed engaging in sports and physical education. I have played Junior professional and college tennis in India. At the age of 12, I started touring the country alone to compete in tennis tournaments and learned how to manage my time effectively between practice, matches, and school. I also had the opportunity to captain my regional team for five years and this experience held me in good stead when I led a team of data analysts.</p>

<p>I always bring in a lean sigma perspective to every task I perform. I have undertaken quite a few process improvement endeavors which have positively impacted the teams that I have worked with.</p>

<p>I am also a big sports aficionado. I play Tennis, Badminton, Soccer, Basketball and Table Tennis. I love Roger Federer and the Golden State Warriors and watch all their games.</p>

**Research Experience**

<span style="color:black">**1. An Autonomous Labelling Pipeline for Enterprise Network Traffic**</span> <span style="float: right; ">SIEDS 2019 (Paper Accepted)</span>  

University of Virginia, Charlottesville 
A novel labeling methodology using a combination of open source data sets (Blacklist and Whitelist feeds) and honeypot logs that can be implemented in any enterprise network. Labeling network traffic will help organizations build a robust intrusion detection systems. (Funded by DARPA)

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis of the Unified Host and Network Dataset**  <span style="float: right; ">SIEDS 2019 (Paper Accepted)</span>   
University of Virginia, Charlottesville 
Uncovered hidden relationships between different variables(Source and Destination Packets) in the Los Alomos National Laboratory's Unified Host and Network Dataset using Unsupervised Learning Methods and verified them using Principal Component Analysis. The hidden relationships can be used to separate anomalous connections through association rule mining.

**3. Comparison of Supervised Learning Methods for Intrusion Detection in Enterprise Networks**  <span style="float: right; ">ECML 2019 (Abstract Accepted)</span>   
University of Virginia, Charlottesville 
Built and compared supervised
